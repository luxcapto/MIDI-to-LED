# MIDI-to-LED

NeoPixel light show that uses the flexibility of MIDI for control. Work in progress!


Uses an Arduino which controls Adafruit NeoPixels and accepts [Serial](http://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/) input converted from MIDI signal and reads bytes for pertinent data to trigger lights or sequence.
